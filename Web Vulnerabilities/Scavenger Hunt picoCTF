Scavenger Hunt 

Welcome
This is how I solveled my Scavenger Hunt on PicoCTF

Hint there is some intresting information hidden around this site 
Inspecting element we find a part of a flag looks something like this picoCTT{t......
We are going to copy that down 
We gonna go ahead and click of the links inside the HTML code. 

Going into mycss.css 
We find the second part of the code.
Going into myjs.js file we find the hint of how to i keep google from indexing my site. 
We go ahead and view the /robots.txt file. 
we get the next part of our code and then we notice that there is also another hint
I think this is an apache server. Can you Access the next flag?
Access is Capitilized so lets go ahead and check that file. 
Using .htaccess file to get our next hint.
It involves MAC and Storage... so using the .DS_STORE to access our last part of the flag. 

To give you some information 

/robots.txt has to do with web crawling. 

/htaccess this files allows you to change to your website's config without changing the servers configuration files. 

/.DS_STORE is Metadata file that Mac uses that store information about a folder and its icons. 

Things I leanred here 
/>DS_STORE 
/.htaccess
