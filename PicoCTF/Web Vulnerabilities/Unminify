Welcome.
This is my CTF write up for the challenge of Unminfiy.
This is an easy challenge to solve off PicoCTF.

We are going to use the hints from the challenge to help us solve this problem. 
One of those things are "I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. 
This right here made us go ahead and inspect element on the web page. 
This gives all our HTML code in one line. Which we can scroll through and get the flag that way. But why not find faster was of doing this. 

One of the ways we can solve it faster is simple using curl command. That would look like this
curl -s titan.picoctf.net:64730 
This will output something a little easier to read then just everything on one line. 
We can find the flag there slightly faster then the last method

We can also grep out flag that we are looking for. 
Knowing the PicoCTF using the following syntax for flag picoCTF{. We can use that to our adavantage to highlight the flag so we dont have to through each line of code. 
That would look like this 
curl -s titan.picoctf.net:64730 | grep picoCTF{ 
That will highlight our flag out of the list for us.
